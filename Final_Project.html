					<h2><center>What we do</center></h2>
					<p> Here at NJ Ecology we strive to make a cleaner and happier New Jersey for all residents. In order to do this we provide information in regards to city services that may otherwise go unnoticed. In addition to this we also provide ways in which you as an individual can make an impact on your community. Below is more information regarding these and if you have any suggestions for us there is a feedback form at the bottom of the page. Now lets make a cleaner New Jersey Together!
